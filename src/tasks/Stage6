Shopping list

Description
Meal planning is only half of the job: we also need to be sure that we have all ingredients! In this stage, the program should generate a shopping list that contains the required ingredients for meals. If several meals require one ingredient, put it in the list only once in the following format: ingredient xN, where N is how many times we need this ingredient.

Finally, let's add the option of saving the list as a file. Add the save command to the menu. Save the shopping list to a file and print an appropriate message. Don't forget to ask users for the file name.

Objectives
Add the save option to the menu. This is how the first message should look in this stage: What would you like to do (add, show, plan, list plan, save, exit)?

When users choose plan:

The save option is available only after users have made the plan for the week. If the plan isn't ready, print Unable to save. Plan your meals first. and go back to the menu;

Ask users about a filename with the message: Input a filename:

When the list has been saved, print Saved!

The format of the shopping list is as follows:

eggs
tomato x3
beef
broccoli
salmon
chicken x2

The ingredients can be stored in any order.
